    <main>The Wendigo is a mythological creature deeply rooted in Algonquian folklore. It embodies the dangers of isolation and the depths of human greed. Often depicted as gaunt and emaciated, with an insatiable hunger for human flesh, the Wendigo is said to grow in size after each meal, perpetually starving no matter how much it consumes. It haunts the cold, desolate forests of the northern United States and Canada, preying on those who stray too far into the wilderness. Wendigos were once human, transformed by cannibalism and dark supernatural forces. This is a punishment for their cannibalistic acts, turning them into a monster that represents eternal starvation. Stories of the Wendigo serve as a stark warning against the selfishness and the violation of civility. Even today, the Wendigo remains a symbol, embodying primal fears and the consequences of losing one's humanity.</main>
