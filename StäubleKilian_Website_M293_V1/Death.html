    <main>Death goes by many names. Everyone will day some day and death is the one responsible for bringing those people into the afterife. Death physically cant be killed, but he also can't kill someone from his own will. Only when their are ment to die. When Death goes to claim a person, he takes the form of the person that ment most to the person who died. its a form of confortation for the person. Death does not feel any emotion of any kind. He has no goals, no need for stimulation. Death can be at different places at the same time so that he can bring everyone who dies into the afterlife.
