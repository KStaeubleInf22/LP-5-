    <main>The MothMan is a flying abomination resembeling a moth, however, this MothMan is not the one from the Nothamerican folklore. This MothMan is a very intelligent demon. The MothMan has the ability to mimic the voice of an angel and the light from his eyes makes it hard for humans to make out the details to recognize that he is a false angel. all they see is a winged beeing speaking to them in the name of god. The MothMan appears to people who are struggling, but have faith in their god. The MothMan is also known for being very fast but not very physically strong, so the MothMan relies on humans submitting themselves to him so that he can kill them. The MothMan originates from the fraud layer of hell.
