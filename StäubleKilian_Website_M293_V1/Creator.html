    <main> The Creator is a being created by the demons of hell. He had the ability to create beautiful landscapes for the cost of consuming a sinners soul. Satan himself presented the Creator as a gift to God, but God was displeased and severed his link with Satan. Satan frustrated that his father abandoned him, let out his rage on the Creator. He stabbed a cross into his head and drew him into a pit full of screaming sinners. In the Creators dying breath he consumes the souls of the sinners in the pit to emerge as a God. He returned to Satan to kill him for the crimes he had comitted against him. He killed Satan and took his place as the king of Hell. He promised the people of Hell, that if they bring him enough souls, he will turn Hell into a paradise.
